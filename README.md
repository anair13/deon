A lightweight utility for managing DEcentrailized ONline datasets

The aim of this utility is to enable data sharing among several users, where
each user may be continuously collecting new data. The command line interface
enables: (1) uploading your data to AWS S3 and (2) managing metadata to
selectively filter and download data from other users.
